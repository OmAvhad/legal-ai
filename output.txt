Free cyber security policy: drafting notes
This free cyber security policy has been created by Emma Osborn of OCSRC to help
small (especially new) businesses to create their first internal policy in relation to
cyber security.
This policy is identical to our basic policy, except that it includes a Docular credit,
and accordingly it covers only they basics. If you need more detail, you should look
at the standard and premium versions of the document.
Issues covered in the policy include: (i) the legal nature of the policy; (ii) the
consequences of a breach of the policy; (ii) specific rules of behaviour relating to
passwords, technical security measures, breach reporting, personal devices and
software installation.
This policy is restrictive rather than permissive.
Clause 1: Introduction
This section outlines the purpose of the policy, explaining to its users why they
should be reading the document and engaging with the problem (and not just
blindly accepting the terms and conditions).
Clause 1.2
This reinforces the responsibility of the employees - cyber security is about people
avoiding making mistakes if possible. The policy is intended to educate or remind
employees about the things they have to do to keep the company secure.
Clause 1.4
Optional element.
Clause 1.5
Optional element.
Usually a policy would be part of an employment contract or tied to a contractor
agreement. This is because policies without teeth may be ineffective - just like any
other contract, there needs to be a consequence for the signatory if they agree to,
but don't abide by, its terms. If you're supplying this policy to volunteers in a
charity or club then you should delete this term and instead focus on describing
your concerns, because you'll be relying on goodwill.
Clause 2: Credit
Clause: Free documents licensing warning
Optional element. Although you need to retain the credit, you should remove the
inline copyright warning from this document before use.
Clause 3: Cyber security requirements
The basic set of requirements gives organisations starting from scratch the
opportunity to make a few small changes before working on a more complete cyber
security policy. It's not complete, but out of the box it should help you to define
user responsibilities and begin developing a culture of cyber security. It picks up on
the most prolific cyber security problems, buying you time to develop something
more precise.
Clause 3.1
Optional element.
Passwords represent the biggest risk of making mistakes that you allow your
employees. It's really important that they get this right, and you should define a
password policy within your organisation, so that you provide a consistent set of
rules with each password you ask them to create.
Clause 3.2
Optional element.
There's nothing worse than thinking you've managed a risk, only to find that people
are (non-maliciously) undoing your security. Causing a breach by circumventing
security should have major consequences as it is an avoidable act.
Clause 3.3
Optional element.
This reinforces the responsibility of the employee and tells them whom to notify and
how. You may wish to put the employee on a timer, to make sure that they know
that this is urgent.
Clause 3.4
Optional element.
If your security approach is to create a secure bubble, entirely controlled by your IT
team, then you need to make sure that employees don't bring unpermitted devices
(and the associated threat of them containing malware) into that bubble. Some
organisations maintain a "public" or visitor Wi-Fi facility in reception, breakout
areas etc. to keep visitors happy and avoid employees trying to bring their devices
in.
Clause 3.5
Optional element.
You might want to add contact details here if the person who installs software is not
the person notified of cyber security issues.
Clause 3.6
Optional element.
Clause 4: Consequences of system misuse
This is where you need to be explicit about the teeth this policy holds. It might be
written in a more accessible language, but it is part of a contract.
Clause 4.1
This list gives examples of purposes a system might be used for but that your IT or
HR teams might consider misuse. This list should only include things you think are
serious enough that if they occur would result in HR proceedings or the termination
of a contract. You should add items as appropriate.
Clause 4.2
Be absolutely clear about the consequences of IT system misuse; otherwise, any
HR proceedings etc. would be unfair on the employee.
Clause: Declaration
The declaration is important whenever this policy is used as part of a contract,
because it provides proof that the employee has seen the document. Also, by
requiring a signature you may increase the number of employees who actually read
the policy.
