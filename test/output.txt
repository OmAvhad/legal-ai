So, as we all know, the global economic activities and trade around the world were improving
during the first quarter, with growth on the upside in many countries. Upside risks to inflation
stemming from various issues such as price pressures on account of renewed trade or geopolitical
tensions in Middle East continued. Weak global sentiments continued amid rising U.S. recession
concerns, leading to lower-than-anticipated macroeconomic data in the U.S., and fears of a
reverse carry trade in the yen after rise -- rate hike by the Bank of Japan. Potential changes in
Govt. in U.S., its trade policies, tariff hikes; slowing China economy may impact global growth.
India's GDP growth continues to surpass expectations. Certain macro-economic indicators have
contributed to the momentum in the economy, including growth in Agri business service sector.
The rise in manufacturing activity and moderate inflation may be a positive sign for easing
monetary policies by RBI. In the recent budget, fiscal consolidation remained a big positive for
the country, with the government focusing on the reduction of India's debt driven by lower
revenue deficit. Capex budget also remained healthy in the interim budget of the government.
All these factors paint a positive picture for the growth story of the country, leading to a positive
momentum for the growth of industry and people.
The year 2024 continues to be a milestone year for the company. In the results for the year ended
March 2024, we had announced a record-breaking top line with the sale of over 2 million air
conditioners in FY '24, indicating a strong market demand for the company's products,
registering a quarterly growth of 72% and an annual growth of 35% in volumes at that time. As
Page 2 of 15
Voltas Limited

we entered FY '25, the rising demand and intense summers helped clock an even strong growth
in revenue and bottom line in this quarter for the company. We are happy to report strong growth
in all the three segments. That is UCP, projects and Engineering Products and Services. The
Unitary Cooling Products business continued to outperform the market and maintained its
growth momentum with an overall volume growth of 67% over the corresponding previous
quarter. Also, in case of bottom line as well, UCP replicated the growth in topline, indicating a
steady margin.
With this incredible growth, the company reported consolidated total income for the quarter
ended 30 June 2024 higher by 46% at Rs 5,001 crores, as compared to Rs 3,430 crores in the
corresponding quarter last year. We are excited and thrilled to inform you that we have recorded
a lifetime high in profit before tax, PBT, in any quarter earned by the company at Rs 452 crores,
a growth of 123% as compared to Rs 203 crores in the corresponding quarter last year. This
quarter's profit is almost close to the PBT earned by Voltas in full year of FY 2024. Net profit
after tax was at Rs 335 crores, as compared to Rs 129 crores last year. Earnings per share, for a
face value per share of INR1, for the quarter ended 30 June 2024 was at Rs 10.10, as compared
to Rs 3.91 in the same period previous year. The corporate balance sheet continues to remain
healthy.
Segment A � Unitary Cooling Products (UCP)
As you have already seen a snapshot for our results, I think the main point here is that unitary
cooling contributed almost 78% of total revenue of the company. Specifically talking about the
segment in Unitary Cooling Products. The scorching heat, rising temperatures and a need for
cooling and comfort helped scale the UCP vertical to a newer height. With joint efforts of our
sales, planning, marketing and manufacturing teams, we recorded another milestone of selling
the fastest 1 million ACs within first 88 days of a quarter, given the unprecedented demand for
cooling products. The extraordinary demand due to extreme weather conditions in most parts of
the country has pressurised and disrupted supply chains across the industry. However, a mix of
round-the-clock operation at factories and strong support from our OEMs have largely helped
in meeting the market demand.
Our quarter 4 FY '24 growth story continued in quarter 1 FY '25 with a whopping 67% volume
growth in Unitary Cooling Products, as compared to the corresponding previous quarter. All the
products in the room air conditioners category witnessed high demand driven by consumers'
desire to have products with advanced features and its long-term advantages of savings in energy
costs. We recorded around 65% growth in split air conditioner categories, with demand coming
from across the country. Strong demand for premium category of products, i.e. 5-star rated
products, continued. And overall sales mix for these products has also improved for Voltas. The
zest of meeting the market demand and meeting customer expectations by giving them comfort
and convenience and making our products accessible through our widespread distribution reach,
leveraging on the supply chain, helped us retain our leadership position for the year, with an exit
market share of 21.2% in June 2024.
Since the past few quarters, we have continued to strengthen our brand proposition and product
placements across all channel formats. During the season for RAC, the performance and
Page 3 of 15
Voltas Limited
August 16, 2024
leadership position continues to remain strong. The company also registered significant growth
in volume for other cooling products, including air coolers and commercial refrigeration
products. Commercial refrigeration industry garnered traction leading to a high demand for cold
beverages and ice creams, thus helping us clock positive results for the business.
Within the commercial refrigeration category, demand was buoyant for water coolers and water
dispensers. The business recorded all-time-high sales in the quarter driven by sales across all
commercial refrigeration products and led to a growth higher than the industry, helping us retain
our market leadership position in freezers, water coolers and water dispenser categories. Our
new products in cold room and medical refrigeration have also registered good business growth
and healthy order booking, ensuring good volumes in the category. However, stock liquidation
of non-QCO inventory has led to a slight drop in margin during the quarter.
Like RAC and CR, the performance of the air cooler vertical added extra flavour to the
milestones of the company in the current quarter with a staggering 170% volume growth over
corresponding previous quarter. High sales in the first quarter have set the path for an exciting
year ahead with advanced booking of coolers for the next season. Aggressive schemes supported
to expand distribution network and, at the same time, quality products; and support from the
climatic conditions helped to establish a strong foothold this season. sell-out remained strong
across all channels.
Our new cooler models were well accepted and further fuelled the growth story for the category.
As per the latest report, market share has also grown to 10.50%, helping us become the number
two brand in the month of June 2024 for this category, widening the gap with brands at third and
fourth positions. Water heater sales had a good start for the vertical and are expected to grow
bigger in the coming months despite this being a lean period for the product.
The commercial air conditioning (CAC) vertical performance also remained steady during the
quarter. Sales of VRF, cassette ACs, ducted ACs drove the top line and bottom line for the
quarter. Unlike product sales in the current quarter, margins from retrofit jobs were lower, which
moderated the overall EBIT performance for the vertical for the quarter. This, however, will
improve over the next few months.
Consumer-centric finance schemes contributed significantly to the increase in sales this season.
Additionally, on the cost front, commodity prices have started to accelerate upwards, with USD-
INR depreciating over the quarter. And both have been detrimental to the profitability of the
business. Considering the seasonality of business, IPL and a move towards TV advertisements
and higher sales and promotion expenses kept our margins in line with the previous year. On the
other hand, various value engineering initiatives and cost austerity drives have kept the margins
stable.
To summarize, for the quarter ended June 2024, the UCP segment registered a revenue of Rs
3,802 crores, a 51% growth in turnover from Rs 2,514 crores in Q1 FY '24. The segment reported
an EBIT of Rs 327 crores in Q1 FY '25 as compared to Rs 207 crores in Q1 FY '24, growth of
58%.

On the capacity expansion front, we are happy to announce that we have started commercial
operations in our RAC factory in Chennai, with a capacity of 1 million and water dispenser line
with a capacity of around 3.5 lakhs in Waghodia. Both these plants provide us with strategic
advantage of location and help us cater to the market in South and West India. This will enable
us to meet growing demand for the underpenetrated air conditioning and commercial
refrigeration products market. This would in turn help us deliver a powerful performance to give
our consumers comfort and convenience. With our story of volume growth across channels and
products, we are optimistic on utilization of our factories to the optimum scale and achieve cost
efficiencies for the business going forward.
Segment B � Electro-Mechanical Projects and Services
The segment revenue for the quarter was Rs 949 crores as compared to the previous
corresponding quarter revenue of Rs 679 crores, a growth of 40%. In the past, while we faced
multiple headwinds in the international projects business, in the current quarter, we reported a
positive EBIT of Rs 67 crores for this segment.
Healthy opening order book, quality Professional Qualifications (PQE), focused project review
and governance structure and a better working capital management has translated into healthy
business performance of the Domestic Projects business. The Domestic Projects business
recorded a growth of 50% for the quarter ended June 2024.
Elections in the country subdued the order booking for the Domestic Project business. And the
order pad stands at Rs 4,769 crores currently. We are anticipating order booking to pick up
during the second half of this financial year. For International Projects business, projects in UAE
and Saudi continued to deliver good performance and drive the revenue growth for the business.
Strong project execution, timely assessment of cost and profitability has ensured a strong
bottom-line performance for our businesses after facing challenges for a few quarters. We are
further elated to inform that in both the matters of our BG encashments which pertain to financial
year '22, 2023, we have received arbitration award in our favour. And whilst the collection of
the proceeds may take some time, our efforts of demonstrating fulfilment of our part of the job
and defying an unwarranted encashment have worked positively.
We remained cautious in order booking during the quarter. The carry forward order book for
international business as of 30 June 2024 stood at Rs 2,734 crores, largely in UAE and Saudi
Arabia region. The total carry forward order book of the segment stood at INR7,503 crores as
of 30 June 2024. Segment profitability was higher, considering the projects achieving threshold
milestones resulting in the accrual of profitability for the jobs.
Segment C - Engineering Products and Services
Segment revenue and results for segment C continued to report better performance for the
quarter over previous year. Segment revenue for the quarter was Rs 161 crores and EBIT for the
quarter was Rs 45 crores, respectively.

Mining and construction vertical achieved a positive momentum on top line, ensuring
continuation of business activities in terms of O&M jobs and sale of Powerscreen machines.
However, margin reductions and ancillary overhead costs relating to the business did not help
us to replicate the top line growth to EBIT. Going forward, robust growth abilities in both
Mozambique and India will help us maintain the business momentum for the year.
The textile industry experienced headwinds owing to fluctuations in cotton and yarn exports. As
a result, capex within the industry decreased across the sector, which led to reduced utilization
levels of spinners and thereby a corresponding reduction in demand and margins for our agency
business. Despite these headwinds, the business performance of our own after sales and post-
spinning businesses has been positive.
Voltas Beko
Voltbek, our home appliances brand, continues to grow with the support of Voltas' strong brand
presence and distribution and Ar�elik's technical expertise, with a formidable team leading
Voltbek. The home appliances industry in India witnessed a healthy growth fuelled by a surge
in demand for both large and small appliances. And Voltas Beko offered an impressive array of
products to meet the demands of the consumers. Voltbek has delivered a volume growth of over
50% compared to corresponding period in the previous year. With regards to the bottom line,
with increased volume and gradual reduction in losses, Voltbek continues to reduce loss per
units and move towards our goal of achieving EBITDA breakeven in near future.
Voltas Beko has solidified its position among the top 3 brands in semi-automatic washing
machines category for YTD June 2024 at 14% market share and overall YTD June 2024 share
in washing machine category to 7.8%. The refrigerator segment also achieved over 50% growth
in business, reporting a YTD June 2024 market share of 5.2%. Other segments such as
dishwashers and microwaves also achieved better business performance.
Voltbek is committed to meet its two objectives of enhancing its market presence across various
product categories by deploying customized approaches for market penetration and growth and
to attain profitability. These initiatives will involve expanding distribution reach, adopting
channel-specific tactics to enhance market reach in key regions through retail and distribution
channels and maintaining a strong focus on boosting e-commerce and omni-channel
development. And on the cost front, localization of production of a larger portion of its product
portfolio, product efficiencies, value engineering efforts and improving product mix have
resulted in a positive outlook for the company.
Outlook
The period of July to September, that is quarter 2 FY '25, is usually a lean period for cooling
products. However, the start of festival period may lead to an early spurt in demand. It will be
interesting to see the impact of the interplay of multiple factors such as inflation, movement in
crude oil prices, rupee behaviour and geopolitical challenges.

I'd also like to inform that company has on June 20, 2024, as part of internal restructuring earlier
announced, executed the share purchase agreements with Universal MEP Projects Pte. Limited,
UMPPL, a step-down wholly owned subsidiary of the company incorporated in the Republic of
Singapore, for transfer of the company's direct investments in overseas subsidiary companies,
namely Weathermaker FZE in UAE (100%), Saudi Ensas Company for Engineering Services
WLL in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (92%) and Lalbuksh Voltas Engineering Services and
Trading LLC in Sultanate of Oman (20%) to UMPPL. The transactions are targeted to be
completed on or before 30 September 2024, subject to satisfactory completion of the condition�s
precedent, including necessary approvals and procedures as may be required in the respective
local jurisdictions and in accordance with the provisions of the share purchase agreement. It is
pertinent to note that post transfer of these investments, the economic interest of the company
and in the aforesaid overseas subsidiary companies shall continue to remain intact.
The government has remained optimistic in meeting its capex commitment for FY '24 in its
budget. And while the order pickup was low in quarter 1, with a stable government now in place,
we anticipate order pickup for our project business. However, we will continue to follow a
cautious risk-mitigated approach while selecting new orders.
For us, currently the execution of the orders in hand is paramount to ensure timely completion
of the projects with tendered margins. In general, we will remain cautiously optimistic on pickup
in the pace of overall economic activity and Voltas will seize the opportunity to continue with
the growth momentum. That's all from my side.
We can open the session for question-and-answer.
Moderator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question
is from the line of Ankur from HDFC Life. Please go ahead.
Ankur: Hi sir good morning. Thanks for your time and great set of numbers. So my first question was
on the room AC segment and more of your market share and how competition is behaving. And
clearly you've obviously been doing a great job of taking back market share. And what I
specifically also see at the GfK data is that Koreans seem to be losing out across ACs, refs,
washers, a trend we've been seeing for the past few months.
So any comments on your side? What's really happening on competition maybe what the
Koreans are thinking? Are they like refocusing more on margins over volumes and therefore it's
obviously helping players like us take back market share? Some color also other players is the
industry a little more rationale in terms of taking price hikes? So yes, some color there on
competitive behaviour?
Management: I would like to refrain from commenting about the competition, but of course, I can talk about
our numbers here. So this year, it has been quite hot and humid summer. And Voltas, of course,
being a Tata group company the faith, love, affection and trust which we got from our consumers
was enormous this year and all along in our journey. So that's one part.

Secondly, we were very strong in managing our supply chain. We had planned better. Therefore,
we could gain on that ground coupled with our wider reach and distribution compared to other
players It helped us gain momentum and continue to gain momentum in our category.
And our product portfolio, and strong dealer network and along with our capability of
manufacturing and providing the aftersales service to the consumer have played well. All these
things have played good role in enabling us to regain some of our market share. And as of June
end, our market share stands at a strong 21.2%. And we have been able to widen the gap with
the number 2 player by almost 800 basis points.
Ankur: Right. And any sense on -- I understand that obviously summers were good and that's helped
overall industry pricing and margins, but even otherwise do you believe or moving on to a high
level of margins? Would that be a fair assumption?
Management: So it is difficult to say because we'll have to play here cautiously, because competition is very
stiffer each passing days, passing months. We've got more than 65 brands available in India and
quite a few of them are private labels as well. So to retain this kind of market share is itself a big
challenge, but yes our endeavour is going to continue to retain this kind of market share and to
remain the market leader.
More than anything else, we would like to retain our leadership. On the margin front, whatever
we have always been giving guidance that we will retain- the high single-digit profitability %
which we have been ensuring all along. And our endeavour going forward also will be to retain
that high single-digit profitability. That's what we can suggest.
Ankur: Yes. And quickly a second question would be on the projects business where clearly margins
looked very healthy this quarter at 7%. So any provisions which have been taken or is this more
like the mid-single-digit margins is what you could -- or you would expect for the remaining
quarters going forward?
Management: In the last few of our interactions with all of you we've shared, we have become more prudent
because in the previous years and in , last couple of quarters we had some challenges. We had
to make provisions on some projects . The payments were getting delayed, etc and also our bank
guarantees also got encashed.
However, this quarter there was no such incident happened and therefore, we did well. And
projects generally give us margin of between 4% and 5% only all along. So that's what we have
been trying, that it should continue. We should continue in that way by remaining prudent in
selecting the project. Actually we are doing a lot of screening from the business side, when we
get the tenders, etc. So we look at it very carefully and select the projects which are prudent and
which are worthy of carrying forward and execution
Ankur: I get that. Okay sir great. Thank you so much.
Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Bhavin Vithlani from SBI Mutual Fund. Please
go ahead.
Page 8 of 15
Voltas Limited
August 16, 2024
Bhavin Vithlani: So my question is on the unitary cooling, if you could just help us. What was the revenue from
the commercial HVAC, commercial ref segment? You gave the breakup last quarter for the full
year number, so this year what's the growth in those segment? A continuing question here is you
mentioned there have been certain one-off costs in the commercial ref segment. If you could just
help us with that?
And on the pure air conditioning segment you mentioned full year profit margins were 10% last
quarter. What were they now and historically we have seen margins in the band of 12% to 14%
and 1 year 15% as well. Now that you have gained scale, you have own manufacturing, could
we expect double-digit margins going forward? May not be this year, but over a couple of years.
Is that something which is also you believe achievable?
Management: Commercial refrigeration and commercial air conditioning put together the revenue share has
been about 18% of the UCP segment. So since you know that we are a very diversified business
house. So all in all our edeavor is to to retain a high single-digit margin, scale up our business
and retain leadership position in all the businesses. That is also of significant importance for us.
And therefore, we are trying to address both retaining the high single-digit profitability and
retaining the number one position, leadership position, in all the category and businesses which
we deal in.
So therefore, I'm not very keen about only increasing the profitability to double digits and triple
digits. That is not the endeavour. Endeavor is to more scale up the businesses in a big way and
expand the industry. That is what we look forward to. As you grow there your absolute
profitability goes up. Your absolute revenue goes up, so that's what we aim for. And you are --
you become a very � number one with a wider gap with the number two, three, four players that
is what we look forward to.
Management: Unitary cooling also you will see that -- last couple of quarters you would have seen we've tried
to retain 8.5%, 9%. So that is what we will be aiming for going ahead. And if there is an
opportunity to improve further, we will not leave any stone unturned on that also, but that's what
guidance I'll give only, the high single digit, as of now.
Bhavin Vithlani: Great. And just that what was the negative impact of the inventory write-off on -- because of the
change in law? You mentioned about that in your opening remarks?
Management: I think usually we do not quantify. We have not said any inventory write-offs in our opening
remarks. We did say there was a QCO-related impact in the CR industry, where most of the
industry players had to sell off their QCO-related inventory at discounted or cheaper prices, and
due to which, we couldn't increase our prices. But we didn't have any write-offs or anything, just
to clarify that.
Moderator: The next question is from the line of Nikhil Kale from Invesco.
Nikhil Kale: Congratulations on a very strong quarter. Sir, so I just wanted to understand, even on the CAC
side, you said the margins were kind of impacted. Can you just highlight what was the issue
Page 9 of 15
Voltas Limited
August 16, 2024
here? And would it be fair to say that like if you kind of keep aside the dry box which commercial
refrigeration and CAC, RAC margins would not kind of improve on a Q-o-Q basis?
Management: So as far as CAC, commercial air conditioning is concerned, you will not see much of a margin
dip. It's about minor percentage point only. However, there also was the impact of the margins
from retrofit jobs were lower, which moderated the overall EBIT performance for the vertical
for the quarter. So that was the reason. This, however, will improve over the next few months.
Nikhil Kale: So then the RAC margins were kind of include in a Q-o-Q basis if you kind of remove this CAC?
Management: RAC quality control order has already happened quite some time back. So that is -- that impact
is, I think, gone away long back. So now RAC margins have been slightly reasonable. And if we
look at Segment A margins those have already improved. Only thing is CAC and CR will have
to look up now after the quality control orders have been implemented and our products are
compliant with this quality control order.
Nikhil Kale: Okay. So what I was saying was like Q4, we did 9.2% in UCP and this quarter was 8.6%. So
can you attribute the decline entirely to CAC and the commercial refrigeration?
Management: So partly, yes, because of Commercial AC and Commercial refrigeration, for sure. But in this
first quarter, there is a heavy advertisement cost. We have to advertise a lot. IPL etc., is being
happening around that time. Then because the sales are higher, therefore, also our subvention
costs, for consumer financing, rebates are higher. So everything goes up relatively and therefore,
I think that has taken a bit of an impact due to that. And therefore, as against, 9.2% margin, we
are at 8.6% at the moment in this quarter.
Nikhil Kale: Understood. And my second question was on the mechanical project segment. So you said that
the arbitration has gone in your of favor. So any sense on what kind of amount will we kind of
have to collect from the BG encashment that has happened. So just some sense on what kind of
writebacks can we kind of expect over the next few quarters?
Management: See, as we have said in our opening remarks, that we have won the arbitration awards, which is
a good win to prove that, the encashments done were unethical or you can even say even without
any reason. So that's a kind of vindicating our stand that we were right all the time. Now as far
as the process goes, there is an arbitration award then it goes thought the courts. There are
appeals, counter appeals.
So I wouldn't be able to confirm when and how we will be able to receive some money. But I
can only confirm to you that whenever we receive in the coming quarters, it could be 4 or 8
quarters down the line or even longer, we will have to follow the court process. The only
assurance we have is that the court processes in these countries are much faster, and we would
see the results sooner unlike some of the results we hear or see in the Indian courts. So within a
period of, I would say, 4 to 8 quarters, we should see this. If we may be able to collect the money,
that would remain the key.
Moderator: The next question is from the line of Siddhartha Bera from Nomura.
Page 10 of 15
Voltas Limited
August 16, 2024
Siddhartha Bera: Sir, given the strong momentum we now see in first quarter, any outlook for the year, if you can
share for the UCP industry or for you, how to look at the growth? And does the numbers in the
current quarter, quarter 1 also include the production from the Chennai plant or it is yet to come?
Management: So let me answer and then probably my CFO can also add to that. Quarter 2 is generally a bit
challenging one because it's a lean quarter and there are a lot of things happening because of
range, also in auspicious period, Shraadh and all happening in India. Many of us believe in that.
So sentiments remain a bit down. And we are not very gung-ho about quarter 2.
And even quarter 3, if you look for AC category, it is not a big quarter, actually because not very
many people come forward to buy air conditioners during this quarter. But of course, for our
Voltbek range of products, quarter 3 is expected to be a good season, is going to be a probably
bit the stronger one. So that is what we are looking forward to. But then also, there are quite a
few geographical -- geopolitical challenges, which are coming across including war situation in
some of the countries, not too happy situation in some of the Middle Eastern countries sentiments
are bit challenging there, U.S. because of election, etc.
So all this is going to play some part in the next 1 or 2 quarters. So we'll have to be of watchful
of all these events as to how it happens. And therefore, we will keep our fingers crossed, but our
dream would be to continue to keep pushing numbers as much as possible so that we remain the
leaders in each of the category, which we represent.
Management: I think just to add, our strategic intent continues to be strong remain with our number one
position. And in that endeavour, we do all our activities in a very cohesive manner, thereby to
give you a very quick and short answer. We maintain our guidance or indication of overall
single-digit -- high single-digit profitable margins -- profit margins. And that kind of remain.
Yes.
Management: I need to also give you answer to the Chennai factory. Yes, Chennai plant is fully ready to start
production. Production has begun in this month. We were waiting for the commercial certificate
or licensing to be approved by the government, which we've received. So production has
commenced. Now they're in the phase to augment and to facilitate us to cater to the rising
demands in this category.
Moderator: The next question is from the line of Sonali Salgaonkar from Jefferies.
Sonali Salgaonkar: Congratulation on the good quarter. So my question, sir, again, some extensions to your earlier
question. Firstly, with the peak summer season behind us, what are the indications that you are
seeing of the underlying demand trend? We understand summer was very strong. There was
stock out at certain quarters and hence, the channel selling can take place. But generally, on the
underlying consumer trends, what are you seeing right now? And how sustainable do you think
your market share gain of Q1 will be?
Management: So you see, India is very hot and humid country. And if we see because of global warming issue,
is going to continue to remain same. And I am not too sure there will be any reluctance from the
weather God that India will become a cooler country. So I think we will continue to get

opportunities. Secondly, if you look at penetration level in India, it's also very low. It's been
hovering around 7-8%, not beyond if you look at. And therefore, that also shows a big
opportunity.
Thirdly, if you look at our per capita income, our GDP growth, everything has been indicating
for a big growth and India is poised for a big growth and India will continue to grow. Next 10
to 20 years belong to India, as I would have said earlier also. So I don't think I have got any
apprehensions about India growth story.
So that is continued -- going to happen. And we will continue to augment our capabilities to be
able to cater to those rising demands. Each, we have earmarked large sums of capex, almost Rs
800 crores to Rs 1,000 crores which we have earmarked for our factories. All the factories are
going in the full swing. We're ramping up production. We are investing into plant and machinery.
So I don't have any doubt about the growth story of India. So I am looking forward to big growth,
and we will continue to keep on harping on those opportunities.
Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rahul Gajare from Haitong Securities. Please
go ahead.
Rahul Gajare: Congratulations on very strong performance during the quarter. Sir, I have one question. Sir, I
think the entire industry is talking about profitability in the UCP business being in the high single
digits. Do you see there are -- you have levers to increase that number, given that government
has kind of eased on China visas or JV approvals, etcetera.
So I think what is your thoughts or the update on your JV on the compressor side if you could
elaborate on that? And just continuing with the same question, given your Chennai factories
commenced operations, you were also looking at export opportunity, given Q2, Q3 are off-
season for the AC products? What are your thoughts on export? How soon can we see that area
also picking up? Thank you.
Management: So there are many questions embedded in the questions but nevertheless, let me answer. Firstly,
when you say on the margins that everybody has been talking about high single digits. I am not
too sure whether all the brands, all the players available in India have shown high single-digit
barring probably, I will say 1 or 2.
So that's one piece of answer. Secondly, if you talk about the compressor status, as you know
that we were stuck up. We tried our level best. We signed up joint venture. But because of
approval for want of that, we could not carry on with the compressor manufacturing earlier on.
However, we have been trying and attempting if we can rope-in some technology partner, we'll
be more than happy to set up a factory very soon. But we are waiting for something to come up.
And as and when the good news comes up, we will share with you. So about that also. But yes,
of course, our endeavour is that we should definitely look forward to manufacturing of
compressors.
Not only compressor, but a couple of other important components which goes into
manufacturing of air conditioner, we are looking forward to building up capabilities in that

direction. So our R&D and manufacturing teams have been continuously working towards all
this. So that is question 2.
Early, you talked about exports business. So exports, we have made some humble beginnings
because of our presence in GCC countries because of our project businesses out there. We've
made some in-roads but it is not worth mentioning at the moment. But yes, of course, going
forward, as we are setting up more and more factories and we are augmenting our production
facilities.
Going forward, we will look at something. But I think if you ask me, honestly, and all of us
know that India itself is providing so much of opportunities. There are so much of potential
available in India. We need to encash upon that before we look at and explore -- start exploring
on the exports.
So I think firstly, I would, whatever factories I'm setting up, my endeavour would be to get that
to the rising demand of India. And in case we got excess capacities then we'll start looking at
developing some of the geographies where there is meaningful business position. And also,
currently, you look at geopolitical situation in many of these geographies, SAARC countries,
Europe had a not so good situation in whether it is called Bangladesh or Sri Lanka financially
also and there are also some challenges with some of these geographies. Then GCC countries
also there is some kind of war-like situation happening. So I think we'd rather like to wait and
watch to get things clearer before we jump in export trade. But yes, whenever opportunities
come up, we will surely look at that as well.
Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Venkatesh Balasubramaniam from Axis
Capital. Please go ahead.
Venkatesh B.: Questions are related to the UCP segment. I think you -- what you have shared is the exit market
share end of June? Is it possible to share what is the market share for the full quarter? That is
one part of the question.
The second part of the question is can actually tell what is the -- how is the channel inventory
looking at? Because we have read even throughout the first quarter that there have been stock-
outs. So is the channel inventory at this point in time like normal levels or it is below normal
levels?
Management: So on the market share front both on the volume as well as value, we have increased our market
share and YTD basis also by 0.5%. So currently, our market share on a YTD basis for this quarter
is 19.5%. And we are about 450 basis points ahead of the nearest rival. So that is about market
share.
Secondly, on the inventory front with the trade, it is not high because the channel and all the
brands were struggling. And so were we also to cater to the demand, it was hand-to-mouth kind
of a situation in the last 1 or 2 months because nobody could have planned a growth of 60%,
70%.

So inventory is not much in the neither with the trade nor with the brands. But therefore, I said
is we are augmenting as we go forward. And this quarter is a bit leaner, so we'll start building
up for the coming second summers for some of the geographies in India and as we go forward
for the next year as well.
Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Shrinidhi Karlekar from HSBC. Please go
ahead.
Shrinidhi Karlekar: Sir, would it be possible to quantify advertisement and promotion spend that you did in the AC
business in this summer season versus same period last year in terms of percentage of sales?
And sir, also a related question I would have is has there been a material change in your channel
mix in the AC business, if I compare this summer season versus last year?
Management: So generally, we have earmarked about roughly around 3% of our yearly budget for the
advertisement. And they will tantamount to roughly around Rs 200-odd crores approximately.
It should come up to, including the ATL and BTL activities which we're going to spend during
the year.
Shrinidhi Karlekar: Has there been jump, sir, if I compare summer period to summer period like year-on-year?
Management: This year, we have earmarked more. Earlier on, we used to do about 2%. But this year, roughly
it has been around 3%. We are earmarking because we want to, as I said is, we want to scale up
our numbers.
Management: I'd just like to clarify, it is 3% for the quarter. But for the full year, we maintain between 1.5%
to 1.75%.
Shrinidhi Karlekar: But we are incrementally looking to spend more.
Management: Yes, I mean, one month, this month here and next month here can happen.
Shrinidhi Karlekar: What I wanted to know is, has there been a material change in your channel mix in the AC
business if I compare this summer versus last year?
Management: Generally speaking, there is no change in the channel mix. Of course, our efforts in certain
geographies are much bigger than what they were in the previous quarter. And therefore, based
on the geography, we all know like South is much more on the organized trade and all. So
therefore, those impacts would have happened. But specifically, we continue to maintain and
service all the channels. There is no one way or the other differentiating between the channels
because all channels are poised for growth, and we are looking at that with that eye.
Moderator: The next question is from the line of Pulkit from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Pulkit: Sir, congratulations on your market share gain. My question is related to this. Sir, what we
understand it, there's been pretty significant discounting that Voltas has done due to subvention
scheme in order to gain the market share back, obviously, your distribution and etc., health. But
do you think the brand has now sort of moved from premium economy to more like an economy

category in terms of where our placement is relative to competition, and that's really something
that has helped us significant market share in terms of how we are positioned? Would like to
know your view. And if there's a third-party research you've done in order to understand what
the brand perception is right now?
Management: See, this perception that we have done heavy discounting to achieve the market share, I would
say, it's a wrong perception. We as a corporate, we are always focused on sustainable strategies
and trades, both. We never take knee-jerk reactions on any of these kind of things. The market
as such has been greater adoption of consumer finance schemes, driven by consumer behaviour
to opt for finance options and we have been similar increased adoption for our products.
You can call it to the consumer behavior or maybe the new families, they prefer to take the
finance, so therefore, our costs also increased because of that. But it's not that we are going
aggressive in any way to go out discounting or to spend more money on subvention, no. That's
not the right way to look at it. On the other side, I think what was your last question? Could you
repeat.
Pulkit: So it was the first question on have you done any study on brand perception of late?
Management: No, of late we haven't carried out, but generally, we do it once in 2, 3 years only. We haven't
carried out any study overselves. However we are pleased to note that the prestigious Brand
Finance Report of 2024 has ranked Voltas among top 10 brands in India, with Voltas being only
brand listed in top 10 in the consumer durable industry.
I think we seem to have been doing pretty well on our brand image. Brand equity, it goes also
whenever we carry out before the season and after the season also, that we'll be able to share
with you in the next probably time we are meeting up with you. And then generally, our brand
equity scores are also pretty high only.
Management: You can write back to us in case any questions are left. We'll try best in ever to answer you.
Moderator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today. I would now like to hand
the conference over to Ms. Natasha Jain for closing comments.
Natasha Jain: Thank you. Unfortunately, that would have been the last question due to prior commitment for
the management. I now request the management to post closing comments, if any.
Management: I think our last comments remain the same. We are in a very interesting time period of growth.
And we are poised with our increase in capacities and everything to be able to be part of this
growth. And that's all from my side. Yes.
Natasha Jain: Thank you, everyone. On behalf of Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities, that concludes this
conference. Thank you for joining us, and you may now disconnect your lines.
Management: Thanks, everybody.
